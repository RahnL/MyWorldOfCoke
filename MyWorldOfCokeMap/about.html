    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>This map shows a visual representation of the world, and highlights countries where we have a can or bottle of Coke from.</p>
    More information can be found at <a href="http://myworldofcoke.com">MyWorldOfCoke.com</a>.

    The dates in the database are rough estimates, since we didn't have the list in front of us when we did this. We'll update it later,
    as we add in the full list of countries.
