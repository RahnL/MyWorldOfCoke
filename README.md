# MyWorldOfCoke
This shows a visualization of countries of the world, where ones listed in a database are highlighted and given some info in a tooltip.
The live, PHP version of the site is at http://myworldofcoke.com/map.php.

Technologies:
- Javascript
- D3 for visualization
- ASP.Net and PHP for backend DB connection
- Azure SQL database
  -- Note the DB may be taken down because I may move it elsewhere. (And I don't want to publish the credentials for a live site.)

To do:
- I think it would be fun to geocode IP addresses of visitors and plot on map.
